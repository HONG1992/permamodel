summary: "Kudryavtsev et al. (1974), Ku model, presented an approximatively solution of the Stefan problem. The model provides a steady state solution under the assumption of sinusoidal air temperature forcing. It considers snow, vegetation and soil layers as thermal damping to variation of air temperature. The layer of soil is considered to be a homogeneous column with different thermal properties in the frozen and thawed states. The main outputs are annual maximum frozen/thaw depth and mean annual temperature at the top of permafrost (or at the base of the active layer). It has be applied over a wide variety of climatic condition."
