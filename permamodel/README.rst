Permamodel
==========

Permamodel is a collection of numerical permafrost models

Frostnumber
-----------
Calculates the frost number--an indication of the probability
of finding permafrost--at a site.  There are different versions of the
frost number depending on what data area available at the site.  

  The air frost number requires some indication of the annual temperature cycle.

  The surface frost number also requires indication of the year's precipitation.

  The Stefan frost number additionally incorporates soil information.


A sample project that exists as an aid to the `Python Packaging User Guide
<https://packaging.python.org>`_'s `Tutorial on Packaging and Distributing
Projects <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/distributing.html>`_.

This projects does not aim to cover best practices for Python project
development as a whole. For example, it does not provide guidance or tool
recommendations for version control, documentation, or testing.

Implements a semi-empirical/analytical solution to soil conditions 


GIPL
----

GIPL is a detailed numerical model that solves for the temperature profile
of a soil column given its material properties and the temperature and
precipitation conditions it experiences.
